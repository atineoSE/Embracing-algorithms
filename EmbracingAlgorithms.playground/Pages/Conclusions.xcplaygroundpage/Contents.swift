 ## Conclusions
 
 > “If you want to improve the code quality in  your organization, replace all of your coding guidelines with one goal: No Raw Loops”
 
 --Sean Parent, C++ Seasoning
 
 ### Take-home lessons:

 * Avoid loops by encapsulating algorithms into reusable, generic solutions: this makes your code easier to read, more maintainable and more performant.
 * Scalability matters: think about the complexity of your algorithms.
 * Get to know the available functions in the Swift Standard Library: they are generic, well-tested and efficient solutions to common problems.
 * If you can't find an algorithm, consider looking up in the Swift implementation since it's open source.
